# Clinic Management Program
This is a program that manages patient data and apointment times. Patient data and appointments are stored in txt files. Program will read data from the files, and user is given several choices to manipulate with existing data, such as view, edit, remove, search. Similarly with appointments, user can set appointments for existing patients only.
